\paragraph*{1 -\/ Find and open {\ttfamily ../opencv/cxcore/included/cxtypes.h}. Read through and find the many conversion helper functions.}

This path is probably legacy from the old Open\+CV (prior to 2.\+1) library. The new path is probably {\ttfamily ..\textbackslash{}opencv\textbackslash{}modules\textbackslash{}core\textbackslash{}include\textbackslash{}opencv2\textbackslash{}core\textbackslash{}types\+\_\+c.\+h} and for the new C++ types header {\ttfamily ..\textbackslash{}opencv\textbackslash{}modules\textbackslash{}core\textbackslash{}include\textbackslash{}opencv2\textbackslash{}core\textbackslash{}types.\+hpp}.

In the book it\textquotesingle{}s written {\ttfamily cv\+::\+Mat33f}, but there\textquotesingle{}s no such class.

It simply works, the vector becomes a matrix, so it can be multiplied by another one doing\+:
