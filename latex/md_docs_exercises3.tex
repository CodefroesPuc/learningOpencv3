\paragraph*{1 -\/ Find and open {\ttfamily ../opencv/cxcore/included/cxtypes.h}. Read through and find the many conversion helper functions.}

This path is probably legacy from the old Open\+CV (prior to 2.\+1) library. The new path is probably {\ttfamily ..\textbackslash{}opencv\textbackslash{}modules\textbackslash{}core\textbackslash{}include\textbackslash{}opencv2\textbackslash{}core\textbackslash{}types\+\_\+c.\+h} and for the new C++ types header {\ttfamily ..\textbackslash{}opencv\textbackslash{}modules\textbackslash{}core\textbackslash{}include\textbackslash{}opencv2\textbackslash{}core\textbackslash{}types.\+hpp}.

Whole code is here \href{https://github.com/CodefroesPuc/learningOpencv3/blob/master/Cap3/exercises3.cpp}{\tt exercises3.\+cpp}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Choose a negative floating-\/point number. 
\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}
    \textcolor{keywordtype}{float} number = 0.f; 
    std::cout << \textcolor{stringliteral}{"Insert a negative floating-point number: "};
    std::cin >> number;
\end{DoxyCodeInclude}

\item Take its absolute value, round it, and then take its ceiling and floor. 
\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}
    \textcolor{keywordtype}{float} abs = cv::abs(number);
    \textcolor{keywordtype}{float} rounded = cvRound(abs);
    \textcolor{keywordtype}{float} ceiled = cvCeil(rounded);
    std::cout << \textcolor{stringliteral}{"Result is "} << ceiled << std::endl;
\end{DoxyCodeInclude}

\item Generate some random numbers. 
\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}
    cv::RNG rng(0xFFFFFFFF);
    \textcolor{keywordflow}{for} (\textcolor{keywordtype}{int} i = 0; i < 5; i++)
    \{
        \textcolor{keywordtype}{float} random = rng.uniform(0,255);
        std::cout << random << std::endl;
    \}
\end{DoxyCodeInclude}

\item Create a floating-\/point {\ttfamily cv\+::\+Point2f} and convert it to an integer {\ttfamily cv\+::\+Point}. Convert a {\ttfamily cv\+::\+Point} to a {\ttfamily cv\+::\+Point2f}. 
\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}
    cv::Point2f pntf(3.5, 3.5);
    std::cout << pntf << std::endl;
    cv::Point pnt = (cv::Point)pntf;
    std::cout << pnt << std::endl;
    std::cout << (cv::Point2f)pnt << std::endl;
\end{DoxyCodeInclude}
 \paragraph*{2 -\/ Compact matrix and vector types\+:}
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
In the book it\textquotesingle{}s written {\ttfamily cv\+::\+Mat33f}, but there\textquotesingle{}s no such class.
\end{DoxyNote}

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Using the {\ttfamily cv\+::\+Matx33f} and {\ttfamily cv\+::\+Vec3f} objects (respectively), create a 3x3 matrix and 3-\/row vector. 
\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}
    cv::Matx33f mat33(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9);
    std::cout << mat33 << std::endl;
    cv::Vec3f vec3(1, 2, 3);
    std::cout << vec3 << std::endl;
\end{DoxyCodeInclude}

\item Can you multiply them together directly? If not, why not? ~\newline
 If by \char`\"{}multiply them together\char`\"{}, the authors mean Matx33f$\ast$\+Vec3, then it compiles as we are multiplying matrixes with dimensions 3x3 and a 3-\/elements vector. The values are right, but as the result is a vector, we don\textquotesingle{}t have the information if it is a line or column vector. 
\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}
    std::cout << mat33 * vec3 << std::endl;
\end{DoxyCodeInclude}
 \paragraph*{3 -\/ Compact matrix and vector template types\+:}
\end{DoxyEnumerate}


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Using the {\ttfamily cv\+::\+Mat$<$$>$} and {\ttfamily cv\+::\+Vec$<$$>$} templates ( respectively), create a 3x3 matrix and 3-\/row vector. 
\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}
    cv::Matx<int,3,3> mat33t(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9);
    std::cout << mat33 << std::endl;
    cv::Vec<int,3> vec3t(1, 2, 3);
    std::cout << vec3t << std::endl;    
\end{DoxyCodeInclude}

\item Can you multiply them together directly? If not, why not? 
\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}
    std::cout << mat33t * vec3t << std::endl;
\end{DoxyCodeInclude}
 It works the same way and for the same reason. The values are right, but as the result is a vector, we don\textquotesingle{}t have the information if it is a line or column vector.
\item Try type-\/casting the vector object to a 3x1 matrix, using the {\ttfamily cv\+::\+Mat$<$$>$} template. What happens now? 
\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}
    cv::Matx<int, 3, 1> mat2 = (cv::Matx<int, 3, 1>)vec3;
    std::cout << mat2 << std::endl;
\end{DoxyCodeInclude}
It simply works, the vector becomes a matrix, so it can be multiplied by another one doing (inner dimensions do agree)\+: 
\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}
    std::cout << mat33t * mat2 << std::endl;
\end{DoxyCodeInclude}
Now the result is correct as we got a 3x1 matrix (or column vector).
